# SimonSaysGame

A simple Simon Says game built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This game challenges players to remember and repeat a sequence of flashing colored buttons. Each level, a new color is added to the sequence, and the player must replicate the sequence correctly to progress.

How to Play
Press any key to start the game.
A sequence of buttons will flash one by one, with an increasing number of buttons each level.
Click the buttons in the same order they flashed.
Continue to progress through levels until you make a mistake.
After a mistake, the game will display your score, and you can start again by pressing any key.
